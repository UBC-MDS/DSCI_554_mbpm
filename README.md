## Main question:
A Survey of:

_Does the first programming language learned influence whether someone prefers Python or R when it comes to data analysis?_

## Other questions & Justifications:
1. What is the first computing language you learned?
  -  This survey question explores the influence of specific languages for the preference of Python or R.
2. What was your undergraduate degree in? 
  - Educational background will influence what programming language one prefers to learn first.
3. What is the typical size of your analysis projects? Small(10K rows), Medium(10-1M Rows), or large (1m+ rows) ?
  - The size of a data analysis project might influence the language a person tends to use because of difference in speed and ease of setup/use.  
4. Which language do you think has better documentation when it comes to Data Analysis?
  - We believe having clear and concise documentation aids in the ease of applying data analysis principles and decreases the learning curve of the language. If clear examples of analysis using the languages of R or Python are not given, the user might tend to prefer to choose the one they believe has better documentation that helps them through the process.  

## Plan of Survey Analysis.

We plan to use logistic regression to analysis how someone's preference to use R or Python for a data analysis task is influenced by the first programming language learned they have learned, while also controlling for confounding effects. We chose a logisitic regression because we have a binary response variable, either R or Python, and will the other survery question answers as explanatory variables.
