## How to Contribute  

The easiest way to contribute is to file an issue or open a pull request telling us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, a factual error, or an update you think is worth while.  

To increase the chances that your contributions are incorporated into the project follow the following guidelines:  
1. Meaningful `commit` messages  
2. Any code follows the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide  

Now, you are just waiting on us. The project administrators will endeavor to reply to issues and review pull requests within three business days. For pull requests, we may recommend changes or improvements to be made before accepting your work.  

For a pull request to be merged it must be accepted by two of the project administrators identified below.
