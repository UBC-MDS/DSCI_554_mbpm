## How to Contribute  

Team members will be assigned project task each week using `GitHub's` issue tracker.

All contributions by team members will be made by working on a local version, either a forked repository or personal branch, and then submitting a pull request for the group to review. If there are suggestions for improvements a review of the pull request will be made to inform the author and the rest of the group.  

To increase the chances that the contributions are incorporated into the project we agree on the following guidelines:  
1. Meaningful `commit` messages  
2. Any code follows the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide  

The group will endeavor to reply to issues and review pull requests within three business days.  

For a pull request to be merged it must be reviewed and accepted by two other group members identified below.
